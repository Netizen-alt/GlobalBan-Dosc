    ### Installing
    - Head To the [Download Backend and Script](https://github.com/DataTechX/Fivem-Globalban)

    - Open the `example.env` you just downloaded.
    - Extract it somewhere you want to store it. We'll pick `C:\Backend`

    ### Starting
    
    - In the extracted folder, find <DefinitionText text={"package.json"}/> and double click it.
    - Then install Nodejs with the following command: `npm install`.
    - After that, find the file `example.env`, change the name to `.env` first and then edit it inside..
    - After that use this command to run the entire system `node app.js`.
